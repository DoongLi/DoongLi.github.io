An open-source 4WS-4WD agricultural autonomous navigation robot platform that enhances maneuverability and terrain adaptability using an omni-directional kinematic model. The system integrates GNSS RTK, IMU, and steering angle encoders for high-precision localization and path tracking, validated through simulations and real-world tests. All open-source resources are available in the designated repository.
