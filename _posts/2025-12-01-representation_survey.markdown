This paper categorizes core robotics modules into five parts: Perception, Mapping, Localization, Navigation, and Manipulation. It reviews standard 3D scene representation methods, compares their strengths and limitations across these modules, and addresses the central question: What is the best 3D scene representation for robotics? The paper further discusses future trends, focusing on how 3D Foundation Models could serve as a unified solution for robotic applications, while highlighting remaining challenges. It aims to provide a concise yet comprehensive resource for both newcomers and experts in the field.
