While I was a Research Assistant at SUSTech, I developed various robotic platforms, including mobile robots and robotic arms. I utilized a range of sensors such as 2D/3D Lidar, depth cameras, millimeter-wave radar, and RFID, I implemented V-SLAM(ORB-SLAM, VINS, and RTAPMAP), Lidar-SLAM(Cartographer, LOAM/Lego-LOAM). I also developed a grasping system based on tags.
