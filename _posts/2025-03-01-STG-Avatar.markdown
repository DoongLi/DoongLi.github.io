We present STG-Avatar, a 3DGS-based framework for high-fidelity animatable human avatar reconstruction. Specifically, our framework introduces a rigid-nonrigid coupled deformation framework that synergistically integrates Spacetime Gaussians (STG) with linear blend skinning (LBS). In this hybrid design, LBS enables real-time skeletal control by driving global pose transformations, while STG complements it through spacetime-adaptive optimization of 3D Gaussians. Furthermore, we employ optical flow to identify high-dynamic regions and guide the adaptive densification of 3D Gaussians in these regions.
